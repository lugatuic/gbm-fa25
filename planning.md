Internal planning document just outlining my thought process for the structure and contents of the GBM slides. 
This will probably be removed when the official push happens but its not like anything sensitive will be in here...

GBM SP 2025 Structure:

  - One page description of what LUG is
  - "Fun Facts" Section (cute, keep it in, maybe expand?)
## Meet the Officers

    NOTE: we should probably get some social media presence when we start to pick up steam again

  - Wikipedia-y explanation of what LUG is
## Why Linux?

# What is LUG?
Purpose: Now that we have introduced Linux and FOSS and justified why we think they're important, use that to introduce LUG and explain our dedication to supporting FOSS and similar things. 

- **Why "Linux Users"?**
  - Outline using Linux is a preference, not a requirement
    - Genuinely important, people get put off bcs of this at first
  - Explain what we mean when we imply we represent "Linux Users"
    - FOSS development and support
    - Right to Repair
    - Interest in Low-Level tech & Security
- **Why LUG?**
  - Justify why we need a collective for these individuals
    - Hosting events and Workshops
      - Share knowledge
      - Encourage teamwork
      - Talk about interests with like-minded people
    - Work on "real" projects
      - Make things that might actually get used by other people
      - Interface with hardware, work with real data, manage real packets, etc.

## Who is LUG?
Literally just the "meet the officers" part again just renamed to fit a pattern :)

# LUG History
At this point, we've properly defined and introduced LUG as an organization, introduced our executive board, and outlined our general goals and beliefs. This is the time to shift from the ideological and administrative to the more material.

## The Past
Set the stage. What *has* LUG done? Showing what we have done before engages members and contextualizes our day-to-day operations and future work.

Introduce other past projects first to show that our work is open-source, publicly available, and covers many different things (hardware, infrastructure, etc.) Our website is our biggest thing yet and is a living project. Perfect for cleanly bridging into the present subsection.

Make this one slide. Individual slides feel empty otherwise
- **Previous Works**
  - SAGE/Bad Apple
  - Door Lock
  - Old Presentations/Events
- **Website** (focus on previous work, core design principles)
  - Knowledge-base
  - Makefile
    - This may be depreciated/changed, but the idea of a FOSS/non js CMS is important
  - Hosts slide decks for previous slide shows as articles, custom articles

## The Present
  - **Website** (Focus on how users can contribute and what makes it living)
    - Markdown to HTML Pandoc
    - Website TODOs 
    - User-submitted customization/updates

  - **Server Infrastructure**
    - `lugboat`
      - Mess with Linux
      - Workshop interactivity
    - `miku`
      - Custom VM services

    <!-- TODO: Section for (Bi)weekly meeting when it gets solidified --->

## The Future
- **This Semester**
  - Planned Events/Workshops 
  - Infrastructure Changes/Updates
    - NOTE: This doesn't mean whole dramatic changes at once.
    - EXAMPLES:
      - Updating `lugboat`
      - PLANS for website self-host
      - LAN Party!

- **How to Contribute**
  - Write Articles!
  - Pitch/Develop Workshops!
  - Write Code!

# Wrapping Up
Contact information should be on the last slide! Its the slide that lingers as people mingle, talk, and interact with one another. Don't make contacting us a task to remember to find out, make it AS EASY AS POSSIBLE.
