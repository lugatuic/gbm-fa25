## Why "Linux User Group"?

We like FOSS & Systems/Low Level topics. What can be described as "the Linux ecosystem" encompasses both of these fields. It also helps that a lot of us are interested in it!

NO, you do not *need* to use Linux to join! (But you should!)

NO, you don't need to be a CS Major to join!

YES, you must Open Source software when possible in our projects!

YES, you will have to learn how to *use* Linux!

## Why Linux? - Great for School & Work!

Programmers:

- `nvim`
- Running same software as phones & servers you work on
- Installing compilers & dev tools infinitely easier than Windows...

Artists:

- Blender, Krita, Aseprite, Godot
- Confine Adobe to a VM

Nerds of various flavors:

- Even the most basic programming can make your life easier or elevate projects
- Make your papers pretty with LaTeX!
- Shockingly, nerds write code!

## Why Linux? - Why Not?

## Contributors 

<!-- TODO: Convert block of text into actual presentation slide --->

Thank you so much to our `Contributors`, volunteer students who have made themselves available to help host events, develop workshops, and aid us with all sorts of things when we need extra hands and minds.

Without them, we wouldn't have moved from the SELE to the CDRLC!

If you are interested in being a more active, helping hand, please reach out to us on Discord after the meeting. Be warned you *will* be pinged when we need help, but the benefit is you stay more in the know and you can

Our website has been in active development since 2022. You can contribute RIGHT now! It is open source and you are encouraged to make changes!

Currently can be found at `lugatuic.github.io`

## The Present - Groups

"Groups" are a new addition to UIC Linux User Group offerrings this semester. Inspired by the ACM Speical Interest Groups (or "SIGS" )

\vspace{.5cm}

- Groups take a lighter approach starting with regular topic related posts on their home on discord. Feel free to join in!
  \vspace{1cm}
We already have had a few great responses in the Rubik group and have learned about new software for timings rubik's cubes! Work may begin this semester on forming new groups including one designed around our workstations, small configurable and temporary local networks centered around our dual boot Linux machine GLADOS (in the LUG office) and aimed towards helping beginners learn to run linux, networking or suggest an idea and perhaps we can help!
