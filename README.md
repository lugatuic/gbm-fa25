Basic LaTeX Makefile-ry

`make all` compiles, `make clean` cleans build files

If you want to add pictures, videos, or any other embeddable multimedia, please put them in the `assets` folder :)

If you want to make a change to the underlying theme, please push changes to the "lug-template repo" and then we can just update the theme version from that :)
